///
/// @brief This is a simple and easy to use json reader. It reads a json file and loads to an objext,
/// which can be printed or singel values accessed throw the keys. There are alse sample files
/// main.cpp and config.json for demonstration purpose only. You must chang them according to your
/// meeds.
///
/// The simple example as console application shown in the file main.cpp should be self explanatory. The sample
/// uses the generated json object and its methods to print or access the json elements throw its keys. The
/// usage cases are commented in the main.cpp example. Have fun!
